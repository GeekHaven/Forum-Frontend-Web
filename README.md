## Contribution Guidelines :balance_scale:	
- Claim Issues: It doesn't matter whether you know how to solve it. Don't look out for issues you know how to solve, but rather ones you don't know how to solve! This will be your opening door to learning something new. :muscle:	
- Issues will be assigned on a first come first serve basis. Decision of the mentor prevails while assigning issues to encourage participation. If you want to solve an issue, comment “I want to work on this issue/ Please assign this issue to me” after which the issue will be assigned by the mentor. :writing_hand:	
- Solve Issues: After claiming the issue, now it's the time to explore ways on how to proceed. Mentors and Google will be to your rescue here. Take advantage of both to the most and join GeekHaven's Discord server.	:man_technologist:	
- Open a Pull Request: After reading everything on the internet ever written and those to be written in future and completing the task, it's the time to open your PR. Contributors are requested to follow the PR template. 
- Don't forget to look out for Special Instructions mentioned that might be mentioned in the issue description. :wink:
- After spending another sleepless night to see your pr getting merged it's enjoy that "I love Programming" feeling! :star_struck: :beers: 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
